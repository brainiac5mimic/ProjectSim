The Milgram experiment was a famous psychology experiment on obedience that was performed in 1963 by Stanley Milgram. 
The experiment was meant to investigate the possible psychological reasons for acts of genocide during Nazi Germany and World War II. 
In the Nuremberg Trials, many criminals claimed their defense as just following orders, so the experiment was created to answer the question of how much obedience to authority conflicts with personal morals. 
The participants of the study were all males that were selected at random from newspaper advertising. 
The participants were introduced to the “learner”, a person that was part of the researchers and had a specific role to act out. 

The participants were taken into a separate room from the learner, with an electric shock generator. 
The participants were told to read words to the learner that he then had to recall, and if he was incorrect they were told to give him an electric shock, increasing the voltage each time. 
As the shocks became more powerful the learner would pretend to scream in pain and beg them to stop. 

If the participant refused to administer a shock, they were given strong orders from the scientist to continue. 
Two-thirds of the participants continued to the highest level of voltage.
