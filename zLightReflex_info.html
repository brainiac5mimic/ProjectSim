&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There is actually a reflex that causes some people to sneeze when they are quickly exposed to sunlight. It is called the photic sneeze reflex, also known as Autosomal Dominant Compelling Helio-Ophthalmic Outburst Syndrome, or ACHOO. This is a condition that affects about 18 to 35 percent of the human population, so you most likely know someone who has this response. What happens is that the people who have this tend to sneeze when exposed to bright light, especially after they have been in a dark place for a while. The photic sneeze reflex is actually genetic, and it is an autosomal dominant trait which means that if just one of your parents has it, there is a 50/50 chance that you will have it.

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This condition hasn’t been studied very much, mostly because it is harmless, but it has been documented for many centuries. Amazingly, scientists and historians believe that the first documented observation of the photic sneeze reflex was when Aristotle wrote about it in 350 BC! He mentioned it in his book called “The Book of Problems”. In his book he posed the question, “Why does the heat of the sun provoke sneezing?” He hypothesized that the heat of the sun causes moisture to build up in the nose, causing one to sneeze in order to get it out. That sounds like a pretty good hypothesis except that it doesn't account for the fact that this does not affect people when they are exposed to heat in darkness, and that it is an inherited trait.
There have been a few other theories about the photic sneeze reflex after Aristotle’s but most have been disproved and it has not been studied very thoroughly or scientifically. The most recent study on the photic sneeze reflex is the one that is most widely accepted by scientists today. It was conducted in 2010 by University of Zurich professor Nicholas Langer who used an Electroencephalography machine to study the neutral responses of people, who either have this condition or don’t, while he exposed them to bright light. From the EEGs he came up with two theories. The first is that the visual system in the brain is more sensitive in people who have the condition. When the visual system is exposed to bright light it is overstimulated and it triggers a response in other regions of the brain such as those that control the nose, called the somatosensory system. The second theory is that in photic sneezers the optic nerve is too close to the trigeminal nerve; so when the optic nerve is stimulated by the light, the trigeminal nerve, which controls facial movement, is co-activated. This activation would appear to your brain as if your nose is irritated, so in response you would sneeze.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last interesting thing about the photic sneeze reflex is that although it is harmless to most people, it can cause issues with pilots. For example, a fighter aircraft requires a lot of precise movements, so if a fighter pilot has the photic sneeze reflex and they were to have a sneezing fit due to the sunlight coming through the plane window it could damage their ability to fly the plane properly. This would be especially dangerous if a pilot is trying to land the plane because that requires a lot of attention. There is currently no way to cure these sneezing fits, but if a pilot knows that they have this condition then they can wear polarized goggles to block out the sun or take antihistamines which have been known to help reduce the probability and severity.
